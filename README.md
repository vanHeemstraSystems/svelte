Like React and Vue, Svelte is a JavaScript framework/library. In general, itâ€™s a set of components, tools and rules for creating the structure of websites and applications with the use of JavaScript. Svelte, however, has developed its own, original way to let developers build what they need and want. Due to this fresh approach, Svelte is sometimes described as a compiler.

React and Vue use a virtual DOM in the browser, which leads to certain performance shortcomings. The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface for web pages. It is an API that allows programs to read and manipulate the page content, structure and styles. You can compare it to temporary memory storage for interface changes.

Svelte, however, doesn't use a virtual DOM, instead compiling code into tiny, pure Vanilla JS. As a result, the code works much faster from the beginning, making a potential app product much lighter and user-friendly. This is the first and most notable difference that Svelte has presented to the world of coding.
